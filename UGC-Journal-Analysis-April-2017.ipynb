    "# UGC's 'preferred' journals are still predatory?\n",
    "\n",
    "In January 2017, the University Grants Commission of India released [a list of 38,635 Journals](http://www.ugc.ac.in/ugc_notices.aspx?id=1604) that it considers 'genuine' and hence articles published only in these\n",
    "journals will be used for academic performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last list published was scattered across 5 scanned pdf documents. It was almost impossible to search. \n",
    "[The Wire](https://thewire.in/102950/predatory-journals-ugc-research/) published an analysis of these Journals and found at least 35 of them [Predatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predatory_open_access_publishing)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "I did an [independent analysis](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/saketkc/19b3c85d2d6ffe17fda8350256c3c64a) and found only 25. The differing numbers arise from the simple fact that those PDFs are hard to parse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that UGC re-released the list in [text format](http://ugc.ac.in/journallist/) on April 14th, 2017. However, the bad news is there are as many as 82 journals that overlap with Jeffrey Beall's list now.\n",
    "There probably could be more, since here I just check for an exact match (case-sensitive, equal spaces etc.)\n",
