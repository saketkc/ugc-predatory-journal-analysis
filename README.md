# ugc-predatory-journal-analysis

University Grants Commmission(UGC) release a list of [approved journals](http://www.ugc.ac.in/ugc_notices.aspx?id=1604) in order to ensure 'certain' quality standard
in publishing.

Jefferey Beall used to maintain a popular blog with a list of “potential, possible, or probable predatory” publishers and journals.
Though [it has disappeared](http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/01/mystery-controversial-list-predatory-publishers-disappears), 
archived versions exist on the [wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20161202192038/https://scholarlyoa.com/individual-journals/).

The [IPython notebook](UGC's%20'preferred'%20journal%20'predatory'%3F.ipynb) anaylses the list to see if any of these
'preferred' journals are 'predatory'. The motivation of this started with a [tweet](https://twitter.com/thattai/status/822761212807000064) 

Similar analysis appeared on [thewire.in](https://thewire.in/102950/predatory-journals-ugc-research/) with a larger list.
